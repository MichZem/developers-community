This topic contains information on settings and tasks that are common to both [external](knowledge-base-external-knowledge-bases-introduction.html) and [internal](knowledge-base-internal-knowledge-bases-introduction.html) knowledge bases.

### Common, read-only settings

* **Owner Name**: The name of the person who added the knowledge base.
* **Data source type**: This is either "External knowledge base" or "Internal knowledge base."
* **Content Provider**: The name of the provider who sources the content. For an external knowledge base, this is the name of the CMS vendor, e.g., Salesforce, Zendesk, and so on. For an internal knowledge base, this is always "LivePerson."
* **Knowledge Base ID**: A unique identifier for the knowledge base that’s generated by the system. In some scenarios, you might need to reference this ID. Here’s where you can find it.
* **Associated Domain**: If the knowledge base's **Intent Association** is "Domain Intents," this indicates the domain that's associated with the knowledge base.

### Common, configurable settings

* **Knowledge Base Name**: Enter a new display name for the knowledge base if desired. Changing the name of the knowledge base doesn't require a corresponding update to a [knowledge base integration](conversation-builder-integrations-knowledge-base-integrations.html) that uses the knowledge base; the integration is tied to the knowledge base's underlying primary key, not its name. 
* **Intent Association**: If you've associated a domain with the knowledge base, this setting is read-only and says, "Domain Intents." However, if the knowledge base is an internal knowledge bases that uses [Knowledge Base intents](knowledge-base-internal-knowledge-bases-introduction.html#domain-intents-versus-knowledge-base-intents), this says, "Knowledge Base Intents," and it gives you the option to [convert](knowledge-base-internal-knowledge-bases-knowledge-bases.html#convert-knowledge-base-intents-to-domain-intents) to Domain intents.
* **Public**: If you don't want other users in your Conversational Cloud account to be able to view and edit the knowledge base in the Knowledge Base application, click the slider to Off. To facilitate the contributions of multiple persons to articles, the default value is On.

### Modify settings

1. Open the knowledge base.
2. Click **Settings** in the upper-left corner.
3. Modify the settings, and click **Update**.

### Format text in an article

In the Summary and Detail fields of an article in an [internal knowledge base](knowledge-base-internal-knowledge-bases-introduction.html), you can use the following subset of HTML tags:
* `<p>` and `<br>`
* `<strong>`, `<b>` and `<i>`
* `<ul>`, `<ol>` and `<li>`
* `<a href="">`, with support for HTTP, HTTPS, phone (`tel`) and email (`mailto`)

Examples of valid anchor tags:
* `<a href="http://example.com/test.jpg">click here</a>`
* `<a href="http://example.com/1$2324%342523">click here</a>`
* `<a href=”tel:+123456789”>phone</a>`
* `<a href=”mailto:a.b@example.com”>email</a>`

Examples of invalid anchor tags:
* `<a href="javascript: alert(’test’)">click here</a>`
* `<a href="http://example.com/test.jpg" onmouseover="alert('test')”>click here</a>`
* `<a onmouseover="alert('test')" href="http://example.com/test.jpg">click here</a>`

{: .important}
If you're using an [external knowledge base](knowledge-base-external-knowledge-bases-introduction.html), where your content developers are authoring content in an external CMS, you can use the same HTML tags listed above.

The HTML tags render in Conversation Builder's [Preview](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-previewing.html) tool and in the Web messaging/chat window based on the capability of the respective tool, window, and channel in use. Be sure to test in the target channel to verify support.

### Delete a knowledge base
